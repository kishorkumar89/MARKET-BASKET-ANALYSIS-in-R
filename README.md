#### MBA is a Modeling Technique :-> If a customer picks a product 'P1' what is the probability that he buys product 'P2'. and if the probability is high place the products side by side.This technique describes the association between items in a shopping center.
##Technical Term
#What is the probability that i will buy item Y after i have already bought item X
##X &rarr; Y
where we call ***x*** as **antecedent** and call ***y*** as **precedent**.

## Example

1. C1 &rarr; Bread,Butter,Jam
2. C2 &rarr; Bread,Butter,Jam
